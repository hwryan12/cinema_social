I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.\",\"created_at\":\"2014-04-10T20:09:40.500Z\",\"id\":\"5346fa840e0a265ffa001e20\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-06-23T15:57:25.895Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5346fa840e0a265ffa001e20\"},{\"author\":\"crastana\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"crastana\",\"avatar_path\":\"/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/87b1f10dd7dae245ac84657537983336.jpg\",\"rating\":10.0},\"content\":\"The best movie ever...\\r\\nA masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 70's were the best years for Hollywood.\",\"created_at\":\"2022-07-18T23:18:07.748Z\",\"id\":\"62d5ea2fe93e95095cbddefe\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-07-26T14:21:07.910Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d5ea2fe93e95095cbddefe\"},{\"author\":\"drystyx\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"\",\"username\":\"drystyx\",\"avatar_path\":\"/hLLsAvAnVT0cFU7JuuaaItTWXv8.jpg\",\"rating\":1.0},\"content\":\"While I'm writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. \\r\\nIt's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the \\\"Mafia\\\" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\\r\\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\\r\\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \\r\\nThere just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.\",\"created_at\":\"2023-04-02T03:49:51.130Z\",\"id\":\"6428fb5f60975000eb3e9c39\",\"updated_at\":\"2023-04-03T16:45:04.834Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6428fb5f60975000eb3e9c39\"}],\"total_pages\":1,\"total_results\":3}"
